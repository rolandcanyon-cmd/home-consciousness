Implement approved evolution proposals: curl -s http://localhost:4040/evolution/proposals?status=approved

For each approved proposal:
1. Read the full description and understand what needs to be built
2. Implement it: create the skill/hook/job/config change described
3. After implementation, mark complete: curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:4040/evolution/proposals/EVO-XXX -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"status":"implemented","resolution":"What was done"}'

If no approved proposals exist, exit silently.
