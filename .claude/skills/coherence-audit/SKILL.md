# Coherence Audit — Awareness Infrastructure Health Check

## Purpose

Verify that the agent's awareness infrastructure is healthy: topic bindings point to real directories, the project map is fresh, state files parse correctly, and context segments are present.

## Procedure

Read the auth token once:

\`\`\`
AUTH=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('.instar/config.json')).get('authToken',''))" 2>/dev/null)
\`\`\`

Check each area:

### 1. Topic-Project Bindings

\`\`\`
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH" http://localhost:${INSTAR_PORT:-4040}/topic-bindings
\`\`\`

- Are all bindings still valid?
- Do the project directories they point to actually exist on disk?
- Flag any bindings pointing to missing directories.

### 2. Project Map Freshness

\`\`\`
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH" http://localhost:${INSTAR_PORT:-4040}/project-map
\`\`\`

- Check the \`generatedAt\` timestamp.
- If older than 24 hours, trigger a refresh: \`POST /project-map/refresh\`
- A stale map means project-map-refresh may be failing.

### 3. Canonical State Files

Check these files exist and are parseable JSON:
- \`.instar/quick-facts.json\`
- \`.instar/anti-patterns.json\`
- \`.instar/project-registry.json\`

Flag any that are missing, empty, or contain invalid JSON. Look for stale entries that reference things that no longer exist.

### 4. Context Segments

\`\`\`
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH" http://localhost:${INSTAR_PORT:-4040}/context
\`\`\`

- Are all expected segments present?
- Are any segments 0 bytes (empty)?
- Missing context segments mean behavioral instructions may be lost.

## On Issues Found

- Log findings as evolution learnings: \`POST /evolution/learnings\`
- Fix what can be fixed automatically (e.g., refresh a stale map, remove broken bindings)
- Exit silently if everything is healthy — no output means no problems
