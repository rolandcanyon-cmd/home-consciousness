# /agent-readiness

Salim Ismail's EXO 3.0 diagnostic, made runnable: score a piece of work on its **coordination-vs-judgment ratio**. Coordination work — routing information, approvals, scheduling, status tracking, prescriptive/standardized steps — is what AI agents do best, so it's *agent-ready*. Judgment work — resolving ambiguity, handling exceptions, navigating relationships, making a call with no playbook — should stay with (or escalate to) humans.

## When to use
- Before delegating a task/workflow to an agent — is it actually a good candidate?
- When deciding whether a process should be fully automated, agent-with-oversight, hybrid, or kept human-led.

## How
Score a task:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"task":{"description":"Route invoices, schedule approvals, track status, compile a report, notify owners."}}' \
  http://localhost:${INSTAR_PORT:-4040}/agent-readiness/score
```
Score a workflow:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"workflow":{"steps":["Fetch the record","Assign accounts","Schedule orientation","Update the tracker"]}}' \
  http://localhost:${INSTAR_PORT:-4040}/agent-readiness/score
```
Returns `{ coordinationSignals, judgmentSignals, coordinationRatio, overallReadiness (0-100), recommendation, reason, matched }`. `recommendation`: `deploy-agent` (75+), `agent-with-oversight` (55-74), `hybrid` (40-54), `human-led` (<40). Deterministic + advisory — never blocks. Pair with the MTP Protocol (`/intent/org/test-action`) to check both "is this agent-ready?" and "does our purpose endorse it?"
